      <p>This is an example online shop written in Haskell (using the <a
        href="http://snapframework.com/" target="_blank">Snap framework</a>),
      backing onto Postgresql.  Source available on
      <a href="https://github.com/rjohnsondev" target="_blank">github</a>.</p>

      <p>The idea was to try and learn enough Haskell to do something real, and
      it was intended to be just a small exercise, but it grew into something
      reasonably involved.</p>

      <p>The frontend has minimal reliance on JS (as in you can use the shop
      with it disabled), and uses good-old round trips instead of any AJAX;
      however minimal HTML and decent asset caching makes this a not-terrible
      way to go.</p>

      <p>It's pretty obvious the interface was thrown together with Bootstrap,
      but care was taken to ensure it responds nicely and scales to mobile
      screens without much fanfare.</p>

      <p>Feel free to play around in the <a href="/admin">admin</a>, the
      username is "test" and password also "test".  The database rebuilds
      itself every 10 mins or so.  Hosting is on a T2 Micro instance, so donâ€™t
      expect too much from it.</p>
